class AdaDelta(df.Optimizer):
    """
    Implements Matt Zeiler's "Adaptive Learningrate" method, aka. AdaDelta.
    The paper itself is really neat, and both very convincing and practical.

    TL;DR: 1. AdaGrad quickly anneals, AdaDelta doesn't. (No proof.)
           2. AdaGrad *is* sensitive to learning-rate, AdaDelta not so much. (Table 1.)
           3. AdaDelta includes 2nd-order approximation. (3.2)

    The updates are:

        g²_{e+1} = ρ * g²_e + (1-ρ) * ∇p_e²
        up_{e+1} = √(d²_e / g²_{e+1}) * ∇p_e
        d²_{e+1} = ρ * d²_e + (1-ρ) * up²
        p_{e+1} = p_e - up_{e+1}

    As in RMSProp, we need to add epsilons in order to create stability.

    It turns out that the effective learning-rate will converge to 1 as the
    gradients decrease (and thus learning grinds to a halt). This could be used
    to check for convergence by a specialized trainer.

    The only reason `lr` is still there is this tweet by Alec Radford:

        @kastnerkyle @ogrisel @johnmyleswhite @tcovert Adadelta raw is finicky,
        shrinking its updates by 0.5 "just works" in my experience as well.
